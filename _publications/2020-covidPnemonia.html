The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed a limitation of artificial
intelligence (AI) based medical image interpretation systems. Early in the pandemic, when
need was greatest, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL)
solutions. Even now, there is a need for Chest-X-ray (CxR) screening tools in low and middle
income countries (LMIC), when RT-PCR is delayed, to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia (CovPneum) requiring transfer to higher care. In absence of local LMIC data and poor portability
of CxR DL algorithms, a new approach is needed. Axiomatically, it is faster to repurpose
existing data than to generate new datasets. Here, we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool
which uses an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for Cov-Pneum
diagnosis, trained entirely on datasets from the pre-COVID-19 period. Portability, performance,
and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. First,
1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine-center to assess effectiveness in excluding
radiologic Cov-Pneum that may require higher care. Second, a curated dataset with 434 RTPCR positive cases of varying levels of severity and 471 historical scans containing normal studies
and non-COVID pathologies, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI
had accuracy of 87% with negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data for
Cov-Pneum. However, sensitivity varied from 0.66 to 0.90 depending on whether RT-PCR or
radiologist opinion was set as ground truth. This tool with explainability feature has better
performance than publicly available algorithms trained on COVID-19 data but needs further
improvement.
