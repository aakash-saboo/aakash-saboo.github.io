Disease-aware image editing by means of generative adversarial networks (GANs)
constitutes a promising avenue for advancing the use of AI in the healthcare sector.
Here, we present a proof of concept of this idea. While GAN-based techniques have
been successful in generating and manipulating natural images, their application to
the medical domain, however, is still in its infancy. Working with the CheXpert
data set, we show that StyleGAN can be trained to generate realistic chest X-rays.
Inspired by the Cyclic Reverse Generator (CRG) framework, we train an encoder
that allows for faithfully inverting the generator on synthetic X-rays and provides
organ-level reconstructions of real ones. Employing a guided manipulation of
latent codes, we confer the medical condition of cardiomegaly (increased heart
size) onto real X-rays from healthy patients.
